Mint 17.1 (Debian based Linux)

I am running a demo of this on both a USB live drive and in virtual box.  

I think that it is a great replacement for someone like myself that are coming from a windows background. 

Initial tests show that at least 90% of the things that I used to do in windows can be done in Mint through various means.  The rest I will worry about later as I continue to gain experience.

I am going through these LF system admin classes to get both the certification that goes with them as well as to gain the technical competence necessary to run Linux on my main desktop.
